        , I've always been curious about how software works behind the scenes, which led me to pursue a career in Quality Assurance. From my early days of exploring test cases and understanding user workflows, I developed a strong passion for ensuring product quality and reliability. Over the years, this passion has evolved into a profession where I specialize in manual and automation testing, working with tools like Selenium, Playwright, and RPA to deliver high-performing, bug-free applications across platforms like Freshworks, Shopify, Zendesk, and Monday.com.

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4">
      As Iâ€™ve grown in my career, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise into areas like test automation, RPA, and integrating AI into QA workflows. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with tools like Selenium and Playwright, and explored smart testing strategies across platforms like Freshworks, Shopify, Zendesk, and Monday.com. No matter how much I evolve, I still carry the same curiosity and drive to explore new tools, frameworks, and technologies that elevate the quality and efficiency of software products.

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4">
      Today, Iâ€™m not just focused on testing applications; Iâ€™m also exploring automation frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and QA integrations with tools like Selenium, Playwright, and RPA to enhance testing efficiency and scalability. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and Iâ€™m always seeking new challenges that push me to refine my skills and contribute to building high-quality, reliable software products.
